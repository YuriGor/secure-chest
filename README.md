Web-safe Encryption and Signing of Data

## Use Case

Intended for storing data with untrusted party. Useful when storing data on server is expensive, forbidden, inconvenient or impossible. 

Data is first signed and then, together with a timestamp, encrypted into a "chest" using a secret. Data can be extracted again and checked for consistency and freshness using the same secret.

Encoded Data is Url Safe and satisfies the regular expression `^[A-Za-z0-9\-_]+$`. 

## Getting Started

    $ npm i --save secure-chest


Below is an example flow that allows users to be signed in without persisting any information on the server.

<!-- eslint-disable import/no-unresolved, import/no-extraneous-dependencies, no-undef -->
```js
const { Chester, DecryptionExpiredError } = require("secure-chest");

const chester = Chester("SECRET-ENCRYPTION-KEY");

// ... facebook oauth flow ...

const token = getFacebookSessionToken();
const chest = chester.lockObj({ token });

// ... store chest with client ...

// ... time passes ...

// .. client makes request and provides chest ...

try {
  if (isValidFacebookUser(chester.unlockObj(chest))) {
    // welcome back
  }
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof DecryptionExpiredError) {
    // ... re-authenticate with facebook ...
  }
}
```

## Chester

Exposes main functionality.

### Parameters

#### secret

Type: `string` or `Buffer`<br>

Secret used to encrypt data. If `string` is provided it is converted into `Buffer` internally using provided encoding.

#### name

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `default`

Name of this Chester. A Chester can not open chests if Chester with different name but same secret
locked them. Ease-of-life, so one can use same secret for different Chester.

Internally input is merged with provided secret and passed into underlying Crypter.

#### encoding

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `utf8`

Encoding used to convert between strings and Buffers. For most cases `utf8` is suitable.

#### zeroTime

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `1514764800`

Used to delay year [2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). Should never be changed.

Necessary since timestamp is stored as 4 bytes.

#### maxAgeInSec

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `60`

Maximum age in seconds before chest expires and `DecryptionExpiredError` is thrown when trying to unlock it. 

When value is changed it is automatically changed for all previously created chests, since chests only store a timestamp.

#### encryption

See Cryper below

#### ivLength

See Cryper below

### Errors

#### EncryptionError

General Encryption Error that all Encryption Errors inherit from.

#### EncryptionJsonError

Thrown from `lockObj` when `JSON.stringify` fails. 

#### DecryptionError

General Decryption Error that all Decryption Errors inherit from.

#### DecryptionIntegrityError

Provided data can not be decrypted. Can be indication for invalid data or incorrect secret or name.

#### DecryptionSignatureError

Data was decrypted successfully, but signature did not match. Can also indicate invalid data or an incorrect secret or name.

Also thrown when context was changed.

#### DecryptionTimeTravelError

The chest is not valid yet. This usually only happens when the zeroTime is changed.

#### DecryptionExpiredError

The chest has expired.

#### DecryptionJsonError

Thrown from `unlockObj` when `JSON.parse` fails. 

### Functions

#### lock

`lock(treasure, ...contexts)`

Create and "lock" new chest. Takes data to encrypt as first argument and contexts as additional arguments.

When unlocking chest where contexts have been provided to lock it, unlocking requires the contexts to be identical.

#### lockObj

Wraps `lock`, and `JSON.stringify` is applied to first argument. On failure `EncryptionJsonError` is thrown.

#### unlock

`unlock(chest, ...contexts)`

Unlock a chest and returns data. Takes data to decrypt as first argument and contexts as additional arguments.

This method can throw various errors (see section).

#### unlockObj

Wraps `unlock`, and `JSON.parse` is applied to return value. On failure `DecryptionJsonError` is thrown.

#### _crypter

Exposes the underlying Crypter. Useful for debugging.

### Example

<!-- eslint-disable import/no-unresolved, import/no-extraneous-dependencies -->
```js
const Chester = require("secure-chest").Chester;

const chester = Chester("SECRET-ENCRYPTION-KEY");
const data = "Some Text";
const chest = chester.lock(data);
chester.unlock(chest);
// => "Some Text"
```

## Crypter

Used to encrypt and decrypt data using `aes-256-cbc` with `16` bit random IV by default (see notes below).

Deals only with Buffers and produced web-safe base64 and hence is encoding independent.

### Functions

#### encrypt

`encrypt(Buffer)`

Takes a Buffer and encrypts it as a web-safe base64 encoded string.

#### decrypt

`decrypt(Base64)`

Takes a web-safe base64 encoded string and decrypts it into a Buffer.

### Parameters

#### secret

Type: `Buffer`<br>

Secret used to encrypt data. Internally this gets hashed.

#### encryption

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `aes-256-cbc`

Defines encryption algorithm. IV length must be compatible.

#### ivLength

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `16`

Defines length of IV. Must be compatible with encryption.

### Example

<!-- eslint-disable import/no-unresolved, import/no-extraneous-dependencies -->
```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const Crypter = require("secure-chest").Crypter;

const crypter = Crypter(crypto.randomBytes(64));

const data = crypto.randomBytes(64);
const encrypted = crypter.encrypt(data); // non-deterministic due to IV
const decrypted = crypter.decrypt(encrypted);

Buffer.compare(data, decrypted);
// => 0
```

## Utility Functions

The functions `toUrlSafeBase64` and `fromUrlSafeBase64` are exposed.

`toUrlSafeBase64(Buffer)`
 
`fromUrlSafeBase64(Base64)` 

## Implementation Notes

This project is considered complete and won't see any major features or changes.

Input values are heavily checked and `TypeError` is raised if invalid.

## Security Observations

GZip is only used when this shortens the output. One bit in IV indicates this and hence only `len - 1` bits are truly random. Acceptable when `len(IV) >= 16` bytes.
